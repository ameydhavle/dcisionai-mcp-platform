# Infrastructure Cleanup Summary

## 🧹 What Was Cleaned Up

After switching to the AgentCore deployment strategy, we've archived the following redundant files:

## 📁 Archived Files

### **AgentCore Redundant Files** (`archive/agentcore-redundant/`)
- **Phase 3 Deployment**: All Lambda + API Gateway infrastructure
- **Lambda Functions**: Deployment scripts and policies
- **API Gateway**: CloudFormation templates and deployment scripts
- **MCP Distribution**: Old CloudFront and S3 configurations
- **Total**: ~30 files archived

### **Phase 2 Redundant Files** (`archive/phase2-redundant/`)
- **Multiple Phase 2 Versions**: Kept only the working version
- **Deployment Scripts**: Consolidated redundant deployment scripts
- **Total**: ~10 files archived

## ✅ What Remains (Active Files)

### **Core Infrastructure** (Still Needed)
- **`enhanced-domain-infrastructure.yaml`** - Main Phase 2 infrastructure (working)
- **`simple-domain-infrastructure.yaml`** - Alternative Phase 2 approach
- **HTML Index Files** - Content for existing subdomains

### **Archive Structure**
```
infrastructure/
├── archive/
│   ├── agentcore-redundant/     # Lambda + API Gateway files
│   └── phase2-redundant/        # Redundant Phase 2 versions
├── enhanced-domain-infrastructure.yaml  # ✅ Active Phase 2
├── simple-domain-infrastructure.yaml    # ✅ Alternative Phase 2

└── CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md            # This file
```

## 🎯 Benefits of Cleanup

1. **Reduced Confusion** - No more conflicting deployment approaches
2. **Clearer Structure** - Easy to see what's active vs. archived
3. **Maintainability** - Focus on working infrastructure
4. **Documentation** - Clear record of what was archived and why

## 🚀 Current Active Infrastructure

### **Phase 2 (Working)**
- ✅ CloudFront distributions
- ✅ S3 buckets with SSL
- ✅ Professional subdomains
- ✅ Content delivery

### **AgentCore (New)**
- ✅ Manufacturing agent deployed
- ✅ All tools working
- ✅ End-to-end workflow functional

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Keep Phase 2** for content delivery and documentation
2. **Use AgentCore** for MCP server and AI capabilities
3. **Add playground content** to existing S3 buckets
4. **Enhance documentation** on existing subdomains

## 💡 Archive Policy

- **Never delete** - Always archive for reference
- **Document why** - Clear reasoning for archiving
- **Keep organized** - Logical folder structure
- **Easy recovery** - Simple to restore if needed
