## üéØ Production Architecture

The production codebase now follows the clean architecture defined in `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`:

### Core Production Files:
- `src/mcp_server/DcisionAI_Manufacturing_Agent.py` - FastAPI agent
- `src/mcp_server/fastmcp_server.py` - MCP server implementation
- `src/mcp_server/http_server.py` - HTTP server implementation
- `src/mcp_server/main.py` - Main server entry point
- `src/mcp_server/tools/manufacturing/` - Manufacturing tools

### Test Files:
- `tests/unit/` - Unit tests
- `tests/integration/` - Integration tests
- `tests/workflow/` - Workflow tests

## üîÑ Migration Notes

### Workflow Implementation
- **Old**: Multiple workflow files in root directory
- **New**: Integrated workflow in `src/mcp_server/tools/manufacturing/`

### Server Architecture
- **Old**: Multiple server entry points
- **New**: Single production entry point with FastAPI agent

### Testing
- **Old**: Test files scattered in root directory
- **New**: Organized test suite in `tests/` directory
