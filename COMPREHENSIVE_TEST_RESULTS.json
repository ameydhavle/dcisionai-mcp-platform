Total investment must equal $10 million.\n  2. The weighted average return across the 4 sectors must meet or exceed the target return.\n\nThis is a standard portfolio optimization problem that can be solved using techniques like linear programming or quadratic programming, depending on the specific objective function and constraints.",
