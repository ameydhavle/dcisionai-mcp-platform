## ðŸ§  **Swarm Intelligence Strategies**

### **Core Swarm Agents**
1. **Solver Selection Agent** - Intelligently chooses optimal solvers based on problem characteristics
2. **Parameter Tuning Agent** - Optimizes solver-specific parameters using ML and historical data
3. **Preprocessing Agent** - Applies model tightening and reformulation techniques
4. **Performance Monitoring Agent** - Real-time tracking of solve progress and resource usage
5. **Solution Validation Agent** - Cross-validates solutions and ensures quality
6. **Swarm Coordination Agent** - Orchestrates parallel execution and resource allocation

### **Advanced Swarm Strategies**
- **Parallel Solver Racing** - Run multiple solvers simultaneously, take best result
- **Adaptive Parameter Learning** - ML-based parameter optimization from solve history
- **Intelligent Preprocessing** - Constraint tightening and variable bounds strengthening  
- **Dynamic Resource Allocation** - Smart CPU/memory distribution across solvers
- **Solution Cross-Validation** - Multi-solver agreement analysis for robustness

## ðŸš€ **Open Source Solver Support**

### **Integrated Solvers** (No Commercial Dependencies)
- **OR-Tools**: GLOP (LP), SCIP (MIP), SAT (CP)
- **PuLP**: CBC (MIP), GLPK (LP/MIP)  
- **CVXPY**: ECOS (Convex), OSQP (QP), CLARABEL (Conic)
- **Pyomo**: GLPK, CBC integration
- **SciPy**: linprog (LP), MILP (Mixed Integer)
