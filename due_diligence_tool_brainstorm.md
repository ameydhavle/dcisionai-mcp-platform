# Due Diligence Tool for AI Response Validation

## 🎯 **Core Vision: Transparency & Honesty**

Your platform needs a **"Truth Guardian"** tool that validates AI responses and discards nonsensical answers before they reach users.

## 🛠️ **Tool Concept: `validate_ai_response`**

### **Primary Function**
- **Input**: AI response from any other tool (classify_intent, build_model, solve_optimization, etc.)
- **Output**: Validated response with confidence scores, warnings, and corrections
- **Action**: Discard or flag responses that don't meet quality standards

## 🔍 **Validation Categories**

### **1. Mathematical Validation**
```python
def validate_mathematics(response):
    """Validate mathematical correctness of optimization models."""
    checks = {
        "variable_consistency": "All variables used in constraints/objective",
        "constraint_feasibility": "Constraints don't contradict each other", 
        "objective_coherence": "Objective matches problem description",
        "bounds_validity": "Variable bounds are reasonable",
        "dimension_consistency": "All expressions have consistent dimensions"
    }
```

### **2. Logical Consistency**
```python
def validate_logic(response):
    """Check logical consistency of AI reasoning."""
    checks = {
        "reasoning_coherence": "Step-by-step logic is sound",
        "assumption_validity": "Assumptions are explicitly stated and reasonable",
        "conclusion_support": "Conclusions follow from premises",
        "contradiction_detection": "No internal contradictions"
    }
```

### **3. Business Context Validation**
```python
def validate_business_context(response, problem_description):
    """Ensure response makes business sense."""
    checks = {
        "problem_alignment": "Solution addresses the actual problem",
        "constraint_realism": "Constraints reflect real-world limitations",
        "objective_relevance": "Objective matches business goals",
        "feasibility_check": "Solution is practically implementable"
    }
```

### **4. Data Quality Validation**
```python
def validate_data_quality(response):
    """Check for data quality issues."""
    checks = {
        "completeness": "All required information is present",
        "accuracy": "Numbers and calculations are correct",
        "precision": "Appropriate level of detail",
        "consistency": "Data is internally consistent"
    }
```

## 🚨 **Red Flag Detection**

### **Mathematical Red Flags**
- Variables defined but never used
- Constraints that are always satisfied or never satisfied
- Objective functions that don't match problem description
- Infeasible models without proper explanation
- Unbounded solutions without justification

### **Logical Red Flags**
- Circular reasoning
- Contradictory statements
- Missing critical steps in reasoning
- Assumptions that contradict problem description
- Conclusions that don't follow from analysis

### **Business Red Flags**
- Solutions that ignore key business constraints
- Objectives that don't align with stated goals
- Recommendations that are impractical or unethical
- Missing consideration of important stakeholders
- Solutions that create new problems

## 🎯 **Validation Levels**

### **Level 1: Basic Validation (Always Run)**
- Syntax and format checking
- Required field validation
- Basic mathematical consistency
- Obvious contradiction detection

### **Level 2: Deep Validation (For Critical Responses)**
- Mathematical proof verification

- Cross-reference with knowledge base
- Feasibility analysis

### **Level 3: Expert Validation (For High-Stakes Problems)**
- Human expert review triggers
- Multi-model consensus checking
- Historical performance validation
- Risk assessment

## 🔧 **Implementation Strategy**

### **Tool Signature**
```python

    tool_name: str,
    response: Dict[str, Any],
    problem_description: str,
    validation_level: str = "basic",
    context: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
