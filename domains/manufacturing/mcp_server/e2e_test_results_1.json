SPECIALIST**\nClassification: CAPACITY_PLANNING\nConfidence: 0.85\nReasoning: The query mentions assigning shifts for 45 workers across 3 lines, which involves capacity planning to ensure no one works more than 48 hours per week.\n\n**PRODUCTION SYSTEMS SPECIALIST**\nClassification: PRODUCTION_SCHEDULING\nConfidence: 0.75\nReasoning: The query mentions assigning shifts, which is related to production scheduling.\n\n**SUPPLY CHAIN SPECIALIST**\nClassification: NOT_MY_DOMAIN\nConfidence: 0.0\nReasoning: The query does not mention supply chain, logistics, or procurement.\n\n**QUALITY CONTROL SPECIALIST**\nClassification: NOT_MY_DOMAIN\nConfidence: 0.0\nReasoning: The query does not mention quality, defects, or inspection.\n\n**SUSTAINABILITY SPECIALIST**\nClassification: ENVIRONMENTAL_OPTIMIZATION\nConfidence: 0.8\nReasoning: The query mentions ensuring no one works more than 48 hours per week, which is related to environmental optimization and worker well-being.\n\n**COST OPTIMIZATION SPECIALIST**\nClassification: COST_OPTIMIZATION\nConfidence: 0.7\nReasoning: The query mentions ensuring no one works more than 48 hours per week, which could be
