# Due Diligence Tool Implementation Plan

## üéØ **Vision: Transparency & Honesty Through AI Response Validation**

Your platform's core vision of transparency and honesty can be achieved through a comprehensive **Due Diligence Tool** that validates every AI response before it reaches users.

## üõ°Ô∏è **Tool: `validate_ai_response`**

### **Core Functionality**
- **Input**: AI response from any tool + original problem description
- **Output**: Validated response with confidence scores, warnings, and corrections
- **Action**: Block nonsensical responses, flag questionable ones, enhance good ones

### **Validation Categories**

#### **1. Mathematical Validation** üî¢
- **Variable Consistency**: All variables used in constraints/objective
- **Constraint Feasibility**: Constraints don't contradict each other
- **Objective Coherence**: Objective matches problem description
- **Bounds Validity**: Variable bounds are reasonable
- **Dimension Consistency**: All expressions have consistent dimensions

#### **2. Logical Validation** üß†
- **Reasoning Coherence**: Step-by-step logic is sound
- **Assumption Validity**: Assumptions are explicit and reasonable
- **Conclusion Support**: Conclusions follow from premises
- **Contradiction Detection**: No internal contradictions

#### **3. Business Context Validation** üíº
- **Problem Alignment**: Solution addresses the actual problem
- **Constraint Realism**: Constraints reflect real-world limitations
- **Objective Relevance**: Objective matches business goals
- **Feasibility Check**: Solution is practically implementable

#### **4. Data Quality Validation** üìä
- **Completeness**: All required information is present
- **Accuracy**: Numbers and calculations are correct
- **Precision**: Appropriate level of detail
- **Consistency**: Data is internally consistent

## üö® **Red Flag Detection System**

### **Mathematical Red Flags**
- Variables defined but never used

- Objective functions that don't match problem
- Infeasible models without explanation
- Unbounded solutions without justification

### **Logical Red Flags**

- Contradictory statements
- Missing critical reasoning steps
- Assumptions contradicting problem description
- Conclusions that don't follow from analysis

### **Business Red Flags**
- Solutions ignoring key business constraints
- Objectives not aligning with stated goals
- Impractical or unethical recommendations

    response: Dict[str, Any],
    problem_description: str,
    validation_level: str = "basic"
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Validate AI response for correctness and quality."""
    # Basic mathematical consistency checks
    # Required field validation
    # Obvious contradiction detection
    # Return validation result with confidence score
```

### **Phase 2: Advanced Validation (Week 3-4)**
```python
# Enhanced validation with:
# - Mathematical proof verification
# - Business logic validation
# - Knowledge base cross-reference
# - Feasibility analysis

```

## üìä **Response Format**

### **Validated Response Structure**
```json
{
    "validation_status": "passed|failed|warning",
    "confidence_score": 0.85,
    "validated_response": {...},
    "warnings": [...],
    "errors": [...],
    "corrections": [...],
    "validation_details": {
        "mathematical_validation": {...},
