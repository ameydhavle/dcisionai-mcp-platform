## 🏭 **Example 1: Manufacturing Production Planning**

### **Problem Statement**
> "I manage a manufacturing facility that produces 3 products: Widget A, Widget B, and Widget C. I have 2 production lines with different capacities and costs. Line 1 can produce 100 units/hour of Widget A, 80 units/hour of Widget B, and 60 units/hour of Widget C. Line 2 can produce 90 units/hour of Widget A, 100 units/hour of Widget B, and 70 units/hour of Widget C. The operating costs are $50/hour for Line 1 and $60/hour for Line 2. I need to meet demand of 500 Widget A, 400 Widget B, and 300 Widget C in the next 8 hours. I want to minimize total production costs while meeting all demand requirements."

## 🏥 **Example 2: Healthcare Staff Scheduling (Partial)**

### **Problem Statement**
> "I'm a hospital administrator managing a 24/7 emergency department. I need to schedule nurses across 3 shifts (8am-4pm, 4pm-12am, 12am-8am) for the next 7 days. I have 15 full-time nurses and 8 part-time nurses available. Full-time nurses work 5 days per week, part-time nurses work 3 days per week. Each shift requires minimum staffing: Day shift needs 6 nurses, Evening shift needs 8 nurses, Night shift needs 4 nurses. Full-time nurses cost $45/hour, part-time nurses cost $35/hour. I want to minimize total labor costs while ensuring adequate coverage and meeting union requirements that no nurse works more than 5 consecutive days."
