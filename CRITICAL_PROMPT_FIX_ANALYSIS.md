# 🚨 CRITICAL PROMPT FIX ANALYSIS

## 📅 **Analysis Date**: October 17, 2025

## 🔍 **Issue Identified**

Even with the enhanced PhD-level prompts, the AI is still generating **fundamentally incorrect models**. The problem is that the prompts are not specific enough about the **correct mathematical relationships**.

### **Current Model Issues (Still Present)**:

1. **Variables Not Used**: x1, x2, x3, y1, y2, y3 are defined but never used in constraints
2. **Wrong Constraint Logic**: Constraints use z1, z2 but assume maximum capacity
3. **Missing Relationships**: No connection between production quantities and operating time

### **Example of Wrong Model**:
```json
"variables": [
  {"name": "x1", "description": "Production quantity of Widget A on Line 1 (units/hour)"},
  {"name": "z1", "description": "Operating time of Line 1 (hours)"}
],
"constraints": [
  {"expression": "100 * z1 >= 500", "description": "Demand constraint for Widget A"}
]
```

**Problem**: x1 is defined but never used. The constraint assumes Line 1 always runs at 100 units/hour.

## 🔧 **ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**

### **The Real Issue**
The AI is not understanding that in manufacturing optimization:
- **Production quantity = Production rate × Operating time**
- **Variables must represent actual decision variables**
- **Constraints must use the defined variables**

### **Correct Model Should Be**:
```json
"variables": [
  {"name": "z1", "description": "Operating time of Line 1 (hours)"},
  {"name": "z2", "description": "Operating time of Line 2 (hours)"}
],
"constraints": [
  {"expression": "100 * z1 + 90 * z2 >= 500", "description": "Demand constraint for Widget A"}
]
```

**OR** if we want to track individual production quantities:
```json
"variables": [
  {"name": "x1", "description": "Total production of Widget A on Line 1 (units)"},
  {"name": "y1", "description": "Total production of Widget A on Line 2 (units)"},
  {"name": "z1", "description": "Operating time of Line 1 (hours)"},
  {"name": "z2", "description": "Operating time of Line 2 (hours)"}
],
"constraints": [
  {"expression": "x1 + y1 >= 500", "description": "Demand constraint for Widget A"},
  {"expression": "x1 <= 100 * z1", "description": "Capacity constraint for Widget A on Line 1"},
  {"expression": "y1 <= 90 * z2", "description": "Capacity constraint for Widget A on Line 2"}
]
```

## 🎯 **SOLUTION: ULTRA-SPECIFIC PROMPTS**

The current prompts are too general. We need **ultra-specific prompts** that provide **exact mathematical templates** for common problem types.

### **Manufacturing Template**:
```python
# MANUFACTURING PRODUCTION PLANNING TEMPLATE
if "manufacturing" in industry.lower() or "production" in intent.lower():
    prompt += f"""
    
# MANUFACTURING PRODUCTION PLANNING - EXACT TEMPLATE

## CORRECT VARIABLE DEFINITION
For manufacturing problems, you MUST use ONE of these two approaches:

### APPROACH 1: Time-Based Variables (RECOMMENDED)
Variables: z1, z2, z3... (operating time for each line/machine)
Constraints: rate × time >= demand

### APPROACH 2: Production-Based Variables  
Variables: x1, x2, x3... (total production quantities)
Additional Variables: z1, z2, z3... (operating time)
Constraints: x1 + x2 >= demand AND x1 <= rate × z1

## CRITICAL RULES:
1. If you define production variables (x1, x2...), you MUST use them in constraints
2. If you define time variables (z1, z2...), constraints must use rate × time
3. NEVER define variables that are not used in any constraint
4. NEVER assume maximum capacity in constraints

## EXAMPLE FOR YOUR PROBLEM:
Problem: Line 1 produces 100 units/hour Widget A, need 500 units
CORRECT: 100 * z1 >= 500 (where z1 is operating time)
WRONG: 100 * z1 >= 500 AND x1 = 0 (where x1 is unused production variable)

## VALIDATION CHECKLIST:
□ All defined variables are used in at least one constraint
□ Production constraints use: rate × time >= demand
□ Capacity constraints use: production <= rate × time
□ No variables are defined but unused
"""
```

## 🚀 **IMMEDIATE FIX REQUIRED**

### **Step 1: Add Problem-Specific Templates**
Add exact mathematical templates for:
- Manufacturing/Production Planning
- Healthcare/Staffing  
- Finance/Portfolio
- Logistics/Transportation

### **Step 2: Add Variable Usage Validation**
Add explicit validation that every variable is used:
```python
# VALIDATION: Every variable must be used
for variable in variables:
    var_name = variable["name"]
    used_in_constraints = any(var_name in constraint["expression"] for constraint in constraints)
    used_in_objective = var_name in objective["expression"]
    if not (used_in_constraints or used_in_objective):
        raise ValueError(f"Variable {var_name} is defined but never used")
```

### **Step 3: Add Mathematical Relationship Validation**
Add validation for correct mathematical relationships:
```python
# VALIDATION: Manufacturing relationships
if "manufacturing" in problem_description.lower():
    # Check that production constraints use rate × time
    for constraint in constraints:
        if "demand" in constraint["description"].lower():
            if not any("*" in constraint["expression"] for _ in range(1)):
                raise ValueError("Demand constraints must use rate × time format")
```

## 🎯 **CONCLUSION**

The current PhD-level prompts are **insufficient**. We need **ultra-specific mathematical templates** that provide exact formulations for common problem types.

**Next Action**: Implement problem-specific templates with exact mathematical formulations and validation rules.
