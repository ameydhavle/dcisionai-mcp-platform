# ðŸ”§ PROMPT ENGINEERING FIX - PhD-Level Mathematical Rigor

## ðŸ“… **Analysis Date**: October 17, 2025

## ðŸŽ¯ **Root Cause Analysis**

The critical issues identified are primarily due to **prompt engineering weaknesses**:

1. **Insufficient Mathematical Validation**: Prompts don't enforce result validation
2. **Variable-Constraint Mismatch**: Model building doesn't ensure variables match constraints
3. **Objective Function Disconnect**: No validation that objective matches problem statement
4. **Result Interpretation Errors**: AI generates explanations without validating actual results

---

## ðŸ§  **PhD-Level Prompt Engineering Strategy**

### **Core Principles**
1. **Mathematical Rigor**: Every constraint must be mathematically sound
2. **Result Validation**: All outputs must be validated against problem statements
3. **Variable Consistency**: Variables must match their usage in constraints and objectives
4. **Proprietary Methodology**: Use advanced optimization techniques and validation frameworks

---

## ðŸ”§ **FIXED PROMPTS**

### **1. ENHANCED MODEL BUILDING PROMPT**

```python
prompt = f"""You are a PhD-level optimization expert with 15+ years of experience in mathematical programming. You must build models that meet the highest academic and industry standards.

# CRITICAL VALIDATION FRAMEWORK
Before generating any model, you MUST validate:
1. All variables are properly defined and used consistently
2. All constraints are mathematically sound and non-conflicting
3. Objective function matches the stated problem goal
4. Model is feasible and has realistic solutions
5. All numerical values are within reasonable ranges

# SOLVER COMPATIBILITY MATRIX

Optimization Type: {optimization_type}

**OR-TOOLS REQUIREMENTS**:
- Variables: continuous, integer, binary with finite bounds
- Constraints: Linear expressions only
- Objective: Linear expressions only
- Model types: linear_programming, mixed_integer_linear_programming, integer_programming

# MATHEMATICAL FORMULATION REQUIREMENTS

## 1. VARIABLE DEFINITION (CRITICAL)
For each variable, you MUST specify:
- Symbol and name
- Type (continuous/integer/binary)
- Bounds (finite, realistic ranges)

For each constraint, you MUST:
- Write mathematically correct expression
- Ensure logical consistency (no conflicting constraints)
- Verify numerical stability (coefficients in [10^-6, 10^6])
- Specify constraint type and purpose

**VALIDATION RULE**: All constraints must be satisfiable simultaneously.

## 3. OBJECTIVE FUNCTION (CRITICAL)
You MUST:
- Match the stated problem objective exactly
- Use the correct optimization sense (minimize/maximize)
- Include all relevant variables with correct coefficients
- Ensure the objective is mathematically sound

**VALIDATION RULE**: Objective must directly correspond to the problem statement.

# INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS

## MANUFACTURING/PRODUCTION PLANNING
- Production variables must represent actual production quantities
- Capacity constraints must use production rate Ã— time = total production
- Demand constraints must ensure all demand is met
- Cost objectives must sum all relevant costs

## HEALTHCARE/STAFFING
- Staff variables must represent actual staff counts
- Coverage constraints must ensure minimum staffing levels
- Availability constraints must respect staff limits
- Cost objectives must include all labor costs

## FINANCE/PORTFOLIO
- Allocation variables must sum to 1.0 (100%)
- Return objectives must use weighted average returns
- Risk constraints must use linear approximations for volatility
- All allocations must be non-negative
