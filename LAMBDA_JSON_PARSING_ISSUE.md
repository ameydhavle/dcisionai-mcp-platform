# Lambda JSON Parsing Issue Analysis

## Current Status

The optimization pipeline is working, but the Mathematical Formulation section is still showing generic placeholder data because the Lambda function's JSON parsing is not extracting the correct values from Bedrock responses.

## Evidence from Logs

```
[INFO] Successfully extracted data using regex: ['model_type', 'variables', 'objective', 'constraints', 'model_complexity', 'estimated_solve_time', 'scalability']
[INFO] ✅ Model built: unknown
```

This shows that:
1. ✅ The regex extraction is working and finding the expected fields
2. ❌ The `model_type` field is being extracted but contains "unknown"
3. ❌ The Bedrock response is not providing the expected model type value

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue is that the Bedrock model is not returning the expected JSON format. The Lambda function is successfully extracting fields using regex, but the actual values are not what we expect.

### Possible Causes:

1. **Bedrock Response Format**: The Bedrock model might be returning the data in a different format than expected
2. **Prompt Engineering**: The prompt might not be clear enough for the model to return the expected model type
3. **Model Behavior**: The model might be returning generic responses instead of specific optimization model types

## Current Frontend Display Issues

- **Variables**: Shows `x1` with "Decision variable" (generic fallback)
- **Constraints**: Shows `x1 <= 100` with "Capacity constraint" (generic fallback)  
- **Estimated Savings**: Shows `$0` (not calculated from real data)
- **Model Type**: Shows "unknown" instead of specific model type like "mixed_integer_programming"

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Improved JSON Parsing**
- Added markdown code block parsing
- Enhanced regex patterns for better extraction
- Added more field patterns (solve_time, solver_info)

### 2. **Access Token Fix**
- ✅ Fixed expired access token issue
- ✅ Frontend now connects to AgentCore Gateway successfully
- ✅ Workflow execution is working

## Next Steps to Fix the Issue

### Option 1: Debug Bedrock Response
Add debug logging to see the actual Bedrock response format:

```python
logger.info(f"Raw Bedrock response: {response}")
```

### Option 2: Improve Prompt Engineering
Make the prompt more specific about the expected JSON format:

```python
prompt = f"""
You are an expert optimization modeler. Create a mathematical optimization model for this problem.

Problem: {problem_description}

IMPORTANT: Respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format:
{{
  "model_type": "mixed_integer_programming",
  "variables": [...],
  "objective": {{"type": "maximize", "expression": "..."}},
  "constraints": [...],
  "model_complexity": "medium",
  "estimated_solve_time": 2.5,
  "scalability": "good"
}}

Do not include any other text, explanations, or markdown formatting.

```

### Option 3: Use Different Bedrock Model
Try using a different Bedrock model that might be better at following JSON format instructions.

### Option 4: Implement Fallback with Real Data
Instead of using generic fallback data, use the actual workflow template data to populate the mathematical formulation.

## Current Workaround

The optimization pipeline is working correctly - the issue is only with the display of the mathematical formulation. The business impact calculations should work once the objective value is properly extracted.

## Recommendation

Implement **Option 2** (improve prompt engineering) as it's the most likely to fix the issue without major changes to the system architecture.
