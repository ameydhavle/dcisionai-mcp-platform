### Key Insights from Real Results

**‚úÖ Pattern-Breaking Success**: The AI correctly identified this as a **quantity-based** problem (x1, x2, x3 = units produced) rather than falling into the common manufacturing pattern of time-based variables.

**‚úÖ 7-Step Reasoning Process**: The model shows explicit step-by-step reasoning, demonstrating our enhanced prompt engineering.

**‚úÖ Mathematical Accuracy**: The model correctly formulates:
- Variables: Production quantities (not operating hours)
- Objective: Minimize cost based on production quantities
- Constraints: Capacity limits and demand requirements

**‚úÖ Business Logic**: The model correctly identifies that we need to produce at least 800 units across all lines while minimizing cost.
